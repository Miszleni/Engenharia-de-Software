Oh Canada!
Our home and native land
True patriot love in all thy sons command
With glowing hearts, we see thee rise
The True North strong and free

God, keep our land glorious and free
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee

Oh Canada!
Where pines and maples grow
Great prairies spread and lourdly rivers flow
How dear to us thy broad domain
From East to Western sea
Thou land of hope for all who toil
Thou True North, strong and free!

God, keep our land glorious and free
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee

Oh Canada!
Beneath thy shining skies
May stalwart sons and gentle maidens rise
To keep thee steadfast through the years
From East to Western sea
Our own beloved native land
Our True North, strong and free

God, keep our land glorious and free
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee

Ruler Supreme
Who hearest humble pray'r
Hold our dominion within thy loving care
Help us to find, O God, in thee
A lasting, rich reward
As waiting for the Better Day
We ever stand on guard

God, keep our land glorious and free
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee
Oh Canada, we stand on guard for thee
